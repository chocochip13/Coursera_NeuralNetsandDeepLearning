## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This repository contains the assignments from the Deep learning specialization in Coursera

Logistic regression/Perceptron has been built using numpy library.

Extending the perceptron idea to build a simple neural network from the scratch by defining functions for forward and backward propagation to do a planar classification of a dataset from a neural network of one hidden layer
